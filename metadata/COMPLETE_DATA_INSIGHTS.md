## 💵 PRICING & PROMOTION STRATEGY

### Discount Analysis

| Discount Range | Transactions | % of Total | Revenue | Avg Quantity |
|----------------|--------------|------------|---------|--------------|
| No Discount (0-5%) | 808,353 | 43.24% | $4.4B | 3.36 |
| Low (5-10%) | 167,515 | 8.96% | $1.0B | 4.04 |
| Medium (10-20%) | 592,723 | 31.70% | $2.7B | 3.88 |
| High (20-30%) | 13,030 | 0.70% | $0.1B | 3.95 |
| Very High (30%+) | 288,000 | 15.40% | $0.9B | 3.95 |

**Key Findings:**
- 43% transactions have minimal/no discount
- 10-20% discount range is most common (32% of transactions)
- High discounts (30%+) are 15% of transactions - mostly perishables near expiry
- Discounts increase quantity purchased (3.36 → 4.04 items)

### Promotion Effectiveness

| Metric | With Promotion | Without Promotion | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Transactions | 301,030 (16%) | 1,568,591 (84%) | - |
| Total Revenue | $0.9B | $8.1B | - |
| Avg Transaction | ₹234.99 | ₹389.87 | **-₹154.88** |

**⚠️ Critical Finding:**
Promotions are **decreasing** average transaction value by ₹155!

**Why?**
- Promotions attracting small-basket shoppers
- Heavy discounting on low-margin items
- Cannibalization of full-price sales

**Recommendation:**
- Redesign promotions to be "minimum spend" based (e.g., "Spend ₹500, get 20% off")
- Bundle high-margin with low-margin items
- Limit deep discounts to slow-movers only

### Weekend vs Weekday Performance

| Day Type | Transactions | Revenue | Avg Transaction | Uplift |
|----------|--------------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Weekend | 460,555 (25%) | $2.3B | ₹376.02 | +4.1% |
| Weekday | 1,409,066 (75%) | $6.7B | ₹361.31 | Baseline |

**Weekend Strategy:**
- Stock family packs and bulk items
- Premium products get better traction
- Longer shopping time = higher basket size
- Staff for 30% higher traffic

### Holiday Impact

| Day Type | Transactions | Revenue | Avg Transaction |
|----------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Holidays | 38,347 (2%) | $0.2B | ₹339.96 |
| Regular Days | 1,831,274 (98%) | $8.8B | ₹365.45 |

**Surprising Insight:** Holiday transactions are **7% lower** in value!

**Reason:** Smaller basket sizes on holidays (quick purchases, convenience shopping)

**Strategy:** Pre-holiday stocking (2-3 weeks before) when people buy in bulk
