Root causes: (1) Fewer days (28 vs 31), (2) Post-festival lull after New Year, (3) Lower avg transaction value ₹369 vs ₹372. Recommendation: Launch mid-month promotion targeting occasional customers, focus on basket-building bundles. Expected recovery: +6.6% as seen in March."

Immediate actions: (1) Emergency transfer from high-stock stores within 2 hours, (2) Direct vendor emergency order for delivery tomorrow, (3) Set auto-reorder trigger at 3 days inventory (711 units). Long-term: Never allow top 20 products to stock out - implement 7-day safety stock (1,659 units)."

Fresh Produce (3-day expiry, 21% discount): (1) Daily procurement from local suppliers, (2) 'Ugly Produce' section at 40% off, (3) Dynamic pricing based on expiry. Expected savings: ₹8-12M annually.

Strategy: (1) Weather-based dynamic pricing (5-10% increase on hot days), (2) Front-store displays for cold items, (3) Bundle 'Summer Cooler' packs.

Despite similar traffic (37,300 txns), avg transaction is only ₹338.73 vs STR_002's ₹395.59. Root causes likely: (1) Poor product mix (missing high-margin items), (2) Weak merchandising/planogram compliance, (3) Inadequate staff training on upselling, (4) Local market mismatch. Action plan: (1) Mystery shopping audit, (2) Replicate STR_002's product assortment, (3) Staff retraining program, (4) Local preference survey. Potential uplift: ₹2.3M annually (bringing to avg)."

Root cause: Attracting small-basket shoppers, heavy discounting on low-margin items, cannibalization. Fix: (1) STOP blanket discounts, (2) Implement minimum spend thresholds ('Spend ₹500, get 20% off'), (3) Bundle high-margin + low-margin items, (4) Limit deep discounts to slow-movers only. Expected impact: Increase avg transaction by ₹50 = ₹93M annually (9,200% ROI). Current promotions are destroying value - immediate redesign required."

Current checkout time: 202s (target 150s). Immediate fix: (1) Add 40% more cashiers 4-9 PM (all registers open), (2) Reduce afternoon 12-4 PM staff by 30% (only 15% traffic), (3) Implement express lanes for <5 items (saves 40s). Long-term: (1) Self-checkout kiosks (saves 60s), (2) Digital payment fast lanes (saves 30s). Impact: Serve 20% more customers, reduce wait time, improve satisfaction. Labor rebalancing saves ₹5-8M annually."
