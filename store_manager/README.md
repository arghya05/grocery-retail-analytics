## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Ask Operational Questions Directly

Simply ask store manager-level questions:

**Example Questions:**

```
"How is MY store (STR_027) performing compared to top stores?"

"What are MY fastest-moving products and am I stocking enough?"

"How much am I losing on perishable waste and how do I fix it?"

"Who are MY top 80 customers and how do I recognize them?"

"When are MY customers shopping and am I staffed correctly?"

"Are MY promotions working or hurting my basket size?"

"What can I do THIS WEEK to improve my store's revenue?"
```

### Option 2: Use the Story as Context

Read `store_manager_story.txt` (improved version) to understand:
- How a store manager thinks through operational problems
- What questions to ask at each stage
- How to execute tactical improvements
- How to track progress weekly

Then apply that thinking to your own store's questions.

## üí° Sample Store Manager Questions & Answers

### Operational Question: "Why is my store underperforming?"

**Store Manager-Level Answer:**

**Executive Summary:**
Your store (STR_027) generates ‚Çπ13.4M vs. top stores' ‚Çπ14.9M‚Äîthat's ‚Çπ1.5M gap. Root cause: Basket size (‚Çπ360 vs ‚Çπ395), not traffic. Three fixes THIS WEEK: (1) Fix stock-outs on Coffee, Oil, Tea‚Äîyou're losing ‚Çπ15K weekly, (2) Stop 20% off promotions, switch to "Spend ‚Çπ500 get ‚Çπ100"‚Äîadds ‚Çπ40 per transaction, (3) Create VIP list of top 80 customers, greet them by name. Expected impact: +‚Çπ75K revenue this month.

## üéì How to Think Like a Store Manager

### 1. Always Think About YOUR Store
- Don't compare to chain averages; compare to top 3 stores
- Focus on what YOU can control (inventory, staff, layout)
- Make decisions for THIS WEEK, not next quarter

### 2. Know Your Numbers Daily
- Daily sales vs. target
- Stock-outs (goal: zero on top 20 items)
- Perishable waste (goal: <3%)
- Customer complaints (goal: <5 per day)
- Staff productivity (sales per labor hour)

### 3. Understand Your Customers
- Who are your top 80 customers? (Know them by name!)
- What do they buy? When do they shop?
- Are you serving them well?
- How do you convert occasional to regular?

### 4. Manage Inventory Like Cash
- Fast-movers: Never stock out (7-day safety stock)
- Slow-movers: Reduce to 3-day supply
- Perishables: Twice-daily ordering, aggressive markdowns
- Know your inventory turns (goal: 10-12 for grocery)

### 5. Execute This Week
- Every insight must lead to action THIS WEEK
- Track results daily
