## CEO DECISION TREES

### Decision: Should we do M&A or organic expansion?

**Choose M&A if**:
- Need fast market entry (< 12 months)
- Acquiring customer base + talent + IP
- Strategic asset available at fair price
- Integration capability proven

**Choose Organic if**:
- Time available (18-24 months acceptable)
- Control over format/culture important
- No suitable targets available
- Capital constrained

**Current Recommendation**: Organic expansion in North (fast ROI, low risk) + Opportunistic M&A in West (strategic gap) + Technology M&A (capability acceleration)
