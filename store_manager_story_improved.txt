    → Emotion: DETERMINATION


================================================================================
WHY THIS SEQUENCE WORKS BETTER:
================================================================================

1. **IMMEDIATE SHOCK**: Perishable waste (Q2) comes early, not buried at Q9
   → Creates urgency: "I'm bleeding money RIGHT NOW"

2. **ESCALATING DISCOVERIES**: Each act builds on previous
   → Act 1: Find the problems (waste, stock-outs)
   → Act 2: Understand the people (customers I'm failing)
   → Act 3: Discover broken systems (promotions, staffing, queues)
   → Act 4: See missed opportunities (seasons, weather, inventory)
   → Act 5: Calculate total impact and commit to action

3. **EMOTIONAL JOURNEY**: 
   Shock → Guilt → Anger → Frustration → Hope → Determination

4. **ACTIONABILITY**: Groups related issues together
   → Money bleeding: Waste + Stock-outs
   → Customer issues: Segments + VIPs + Layout
   → Operational fails: Promotions + Staffing + Queues + Cash
   → Strategic misses: Seasons + Weather + Inventory
   → Synthesis: Performance + Comparison + Total opportunity

5. **BUILDING TO CLIMAX**: 
   - Early questions reveal PAIN (losing money)
   - Middle questions reveal CAUSE (poor systems, not knowing customers)
   - Later questions reveal OPPORTUNITY (seasons, weather, comparison)
   - Final questions reveal HOPE (others do it, so can I!)

================================================================================
COMPARISON: EMOTIONAL IMPACT
================================================================================

CURRENT SEQUENCE:
- Builds slowly, logically
- Shock (waste) comes late (Q9)
- Less dramatic tension
- Educational tone

IMPROVED SEQUENCE:
- Hits hard early (waste at Q2)
- Escalates naturally
- More dramatic tension
- Transformational tone

================================================================================

The key is: START WITH PAIN, END WITH HOPE.

Current version starts with analysis, which is logical but less engaging.
Improved version starts with "I'm bleeding ₹780K!" which grabs attention.
