# Simple vs Complex Questions - Smart Answer Length

## üéØ The Problem You Showed

### Question: "how many stores"

**Bad Answer (Shown)**: 500+ word hallucination about Beverages, STR_002 vs STR_041, ‚Çπ163.5M revenue, inventory levels, strategic implications, execution roadmap...

**Expected Answer**: "50 stores" (2 words!)

## ‚úÖ The Solution: Smart Question Classification

The new system detects question complexity and adjusts answer length:

### SIMPLE Question ‚Üí SIMPLE Answer
### COMPLEX Question ‚Üí DETAILED Answer

---

## üìã Question Classification

### **SIMPLE QUESTIONS** (Direct Fact Queries)

Pattern: Asking for a single fact/number

Examples:
- "How many stores?"
- "How many stores are present?"
- "Total stores?"
- "Store count?"
- "What is total revenue?"
- "How many categories?"

**Expected Answer**: 1-2 sentences with the number
```
We have 50 stores in total.
```

---

### **AMBIGUOUS QUESTIONS** (Need Clarification)

Pattern: Vague, pronoun-only, or missing entity

Examples:
- "How is it going?"
- "What's happening?"
- "Status?"
- "Best performing?"
- "Compare them"
- "It"

**System Response**: Ask clarifying questions
```
‚ùì I need clarification to give you the best answer.

What specifically are you asking about?
‚Ä¢ Stores (e.g., 'top 5 stores by revenue')
‚Ä¢ Categories (e.g., 'how is Beverages performing')
‚Ä¢ Customer segments (e.g., 'which segment to prioritize')

Please rephrase your question with more details.
```

---

### **COMPLEX QUESTIONS** (Analysis Required)

Pattern: Asking WHY, HOW, comparison, strategy

Examples:
- "What are the stores that are not performing?"
- "Why is Beverages doing well?"
- "Compare STR_002 vs STR_041"
- "Which customer segment should we prioritize?"
- "How can we improve revenue?"

**Expected Answer**: Executive Summary + Detailed Analysis
```
======================================================================
üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================================

Bottom 10 stores bleeding ‚Çπ15M annually.

**Key Numbers:**
‚Ä¢ STR_045: ‚Çπ8.2M (worst)
‚Ä¢ Gap: ‚Çπ6.7M vs top

**Fix This Week:**
1. STR_045 audit by Wed
2. Planogram rollout Friday
3. Launch promo Monday

## üîç How the System Detects Question Type

### Detection Logic:

```python
# SIMPLE question detection
is_simple = (
    # Asking for count
    ("how many" in question or "total" in question or "count" in question) and
    # Short question (< 6 words)
    len(question.split()) < 6
)

# AMBIGUOUS question detection
is_ambiguous = (
    # Starts with pronoun
    question.startswith(("it", "they", "that", "this")) or
    # Very vague
    question in ["status", "update", "how are we doing"] or
    # Missing entity in comparison
    ("compare" in question and not has_specific_entities)
)

# COMPLEX question detection
is_complex = (
    # Asks WHY, HOW
    question.startswith(("why", "how can", "what should")) or
    # Asks for strategy
    ("prioritize" in question or "strategy" in question or "improve" in question) or
    # Analysis request
    ("analyze" in question or "not performing" in question)
)
```

---

## üìä Examples with Expected Outputs

### Example 1: Simple Question

**Q**: "How many stores?"

**Detected**: SIMPLE (count query, 3 words)

**Answer**:
```
We have 50 stores in total.
```
‚úÖ 1 sentence, direct answer

---

### Example 2: Simple Question with Number

**Q**: "Total stores?"

**Detected**: SIMPLE (count query, 2 words)

**Answer**:
```
50 stores total.
```
‚úÖ Minimal answer, just the fact

---

### Example 3: Ambiguous Question

**Q**: "How is it going?"

**Detected**: AMBIGUOUS (pronoun without context, vague)

**Answer**:
```
‚ùì I need clarification to give you the best answer.

What would you like to know about?
‚Ä¢ Store performance (revenue, transactions)
‚Ä¢ Category performance (which category?)
‚Ä¢ Customer segments (Regular, Premium, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Specific metrics (revenue, margins, customers)

Example: 'How are our top stores performing?'
Example: 'What's the revenue for Beverages category?'

Please rephrase your question with more details.
```
‚úÖ Asks for clarification instead of guessing

---

### Example 4: Ambiguous Question - Comparison

**Q**: "Compare them"

**Detected**: AMBIGUOUS (missing entities)

**Answer**:
```
‚ùì I need clarification to give you the best answer.

What would you like to compare?
Please specify the entities:
‚Ä¢ Store IDs (e.g., 'Compare STR_002 vs STR_041')
‚Ä¢ Categories (e.g., 'Compare Beverages vs Snacks')
‚Ä¢ Time periods (e.g., 'Compare this month vs last month')

Example: 'Compare STR_002 and STR_041 revenue'

Please rephrase your question with more details.
```
‚úÖ Prevents hallucination by asking for specifics

---

### Example 5: Complex Question

**Q**: "What are the stores that are not performing?"

**Detected**: COMPLEX (analysis request, strategy needed)

**Answer**:
```
======================================================================
üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
======================================================================

**Key Numbers:**
‚Ä¢ STR_045: ‚Çπ8.2M revenue (‚Çπ6.7M below average) - worst

## ‚ùå What NOT to Do (Examples from Bad Answer)

### Bad Response to "How many stores?":

‚ùå "We are looking at beverage revenue performance..."
‚ùå "After analyzing data from STR_002 (‚Çπ14.92M revenue)..."
‚ùå "To close this gap, we need to focus on Personal Care..."
‚ùå "SECTION 2: DETAILED ANALYSIS..."
‚ùå "SECTION 3: STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS..."
‚ùå "SECTION 4: DETAILED ACTION PLAN..."
‚ùå "SECTION 5: EXECUTION ROADMAP..."

**Why it's bad**:
- Question asks for COUNT
- Answer talks about BEVERAGES (wrong entity!)
- Answer is 500+ words for a 2-word question
- Hallucinating strategic plans nobody asked for

---

## ‚úÖ What TO Do

### Good Response to "How many stores?":

‚úÖ "We have 50 stores in total."

**Why it's good**:
- Directly answers the question
- Correct entity (stores, not beverages)
- Appropriate length (1 sentence)
- No hallucination

## üîç Detection Patterns

### Simple Question Patterns:
```python
patterns = [
    "how many {entity}",
    "total {entity}",
    "{entity} count",
    "what is {metric}",
    "when {event}"
]

# Examples:
"how many stores" ‚Üí SIMPLE
"total revenue" ‚Üí SIMPLE
"store count" ‚Üí SIMPLE
"what is ATV" ‚Üí SIMPLE
```

### Ambiguous Question Patterns:
```python
patterns = [
    starts_with_pronoun: ["it", "they", "this", "that"],
    vague_terms: ["status", "update", "how's it going"],
    missing_entity: ["best", "worst", "compare"] without entity
]

# Examples:
"it" ‚Üí AMBIGUOUS
"status" ‚Üí AMBIGUOUS
"best performing" ‚Üí AMBIGUOUS (best what?)
"compare" ‚Üí AMBIGUOUS (compare what?)
```

### Complex Question Patterns:
```python
patterns = [
    "why {anything}",
    "how can {action}",
    "what should {action}",
    "{entity} not performing",
    "prioritize {entity}",
    "improve {metric}",
    "strategy for {goal}"
]

# Examples:
"why is revenue low" ‚Üí COMPLEX
"how can we improve" ‚Üí COMPLEX
"what should we prioritize" ‚Üí COMPLEX
"stores not performing" ‚Üí COMPLEX
```
