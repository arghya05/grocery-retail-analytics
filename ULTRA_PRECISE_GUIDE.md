## 📊 Question Analysis Examples

### Example 1: "What are the stores that are not performing?"

```python
QuestionAnalysis(
    entity_type="store",           # ← Question is about STORES
    specific_entities=[],           # ← No specific stores mentioned
    question_intent="identify",     # ← Wants to IDENTIFY stores
    metrics_requested=["performance"],
    filters={"performance": "low"}, # ← Wants LOW performing
    expected_answer_format="list"   # ← Should be a LIST
)
```

**What the system does:**
1. ✅ Loads STORE performance data (not categories/segments)
2. ✅ Filters for BOTTOM stores by revenue
3. ✅ Generates answer about STORES (not categories)
4. ✅ Formats as LIST with store IDs
5. ✅ Validates answer discusses STORES

### Example 2: "Which customer segment should we prioritize?"

```python
QuestionAnalysis(
    entity_type="customer_segment",  # ← About SEGMENTS (not stores!)
    specific_entities=[],
    question_intent="recommend",     # ← Wants RECOMMENDATION
    metrics_requested=["performance"],
    filters={},
    expected_answer_format="recommendation"
)
```

**What the system does:**
1. ✅ Loads CUSTOMER SEGMENT data (not stores!)
2. ✅ Analyzes segments: Regular, Premium, Occasional, New
3. ✅ Generates RECOMMENDATION (not just data)
4. ✅ Validates answer discusses SEGMENTS (rejects if talks about stores)

### Example 3: "Compare STR_002 and STR_041 revenue"

```python
QuestionAnalysis(
    entity_type="store",
    specific_entities=["STR_002", "STR_041"],  # ← MUST mention both
    question_intent="compare",                 # ← Wants COMPARISON
    metrics_requested=["revenue"],
    filters={},
    expected_answer_format="comparison"
)
```

**What the system does:**
1. ✅ Loads store performance for STR_002 and STR_041
2. ✅ Validates both stores are in the data
3. ✅ Generates COMPARISON (not just individual stats)
4. ✅ Validates answer mentions BOTH STR_002 and STR_041
5. ✅ Validates answer shows REVENUE comparison

## 🎯 Answer Relevance Validation

The system checks **5 dimensions** to ensure answer matches question:

### 1. Entity Type Match
```
Question: "What are stores not performing?"
✓ VALID: "STR_045, STR_023, and STR_031 are underperforming..."
✗ INVALID: "Beverages and Snacks categories..." (wrong entity!)
```

### 2. Specific Entities Match
```
Question: "How is STR_002 performing?"
✓ VALID: "STR_002 has ₹14.92M revenue..." (mentions STR_002)
✗ INVALID: "Top stores have good revenue..." (doesn't mention STR_002)
```

### 3. Intent Fulfillment
```
Question: "What are the top 5 stores?" (IDENTIFY intent)
✓ VALID: "1. STR_002 - ₹14.92M\n2. STR_041..." (LIST format)
✗ INVALID: "Stores perform differently..." (no list)
```

### 4. Metrics Included
```
Question: "What is the revenue gap?" (REVENUE metric)
✓ VALID: "Gap is ₹2.3M between..." (shows revenue)
✗ INVALID: "Performance varies..." (no revenue figures)
```

### 5. Format Correctness
```
Question: "Compare STR_002 vs STR_041" (COMPARISON format)
✓ VALID: "STR_002: ₹14.92M vs STR_041: ₹12.63M" (comparison)
✗ INVALID: "STR_002 has ₹14.92M. STR_041 has..." (separate, not comparison)
```

### Relevance Score Calculation
```python
score = (
    entity_type_match +      # 1 or 0
    specific_entities_match + # 1 or 0
    intent_fulfilled +        # 1 or 0
    metrics_included +        # 1 or 0
    format_correct           # 1 or 0
) / 5.0

# If score < 80% → RETRY with specific feedback
```

## 📋 Entity Type Detection

The system automatically detects what entity type the question asks about:

| Question Contains | Entity Type Detected | Data Source Loaded |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| "stores", "STR_" | **store** | store_performance |
| "categories", "Beverages", "Snacks" | **category** | category_performance |
| "products", "items", "SKU" | **product** | product_performance |
| "customers", "Regular", "Premium" | **customer_segment** | customer_segment |
| "daily", "weekly", "monthly" | **time_period** | daily/weekly/monthly_performance |

### Examples:

```python
# STORE questions
"What are the top stores?" → entity_type="store"
"How is STR_002 performing?" → entity_type="store"
"Which stores are underperforming?" → entity_type="store"

# CATEGORY questions
"How is Beverages performing?" → entity_type="category"
"What are top categories?" → entity_type="category"

# CUSTOMER SEGMENT questions
"Which segment to prioritize?" → entity_type="customer_segment"
"How are Regular customers doing?" → entity_type="customer_segment"
```
