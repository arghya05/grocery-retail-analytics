                        CEO FRUSTRATIONS TO ADDRESS
================================================================================

FRUSTRATION: "The numbers tell me WHAT is happening, but not WHY it's happening. I need to understand what our customers are actually saying."

SOLUTION APPROACH:

- Customer voice: What are top 100 premium customers saying in reviews?
- Competitive intelligence: Why is competitor gaining share? (Store visits, pricing checks)
- Predictive insights: What signals indicate future problems? (Leading indicators)
- Actionable recommendations: Not just 'Revenue is down' but 'Revenue down because X, Y, Z → Do A, B, C'

DATA CORRELATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Internal KPIs ↔ Market trends (economic indicators, consumer confidence)
- Store performance ↔ Local competition (new store openings nearby)
- Category sales ↔ Weather patterns (beverages spike in heat waves)
- Customer churn ↔ Pricing changes (did discount elimination hurt retention?)
- Employee turnover ↔ Store performance (bad managers = bad results)
