## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. **Be Specific for Complex Questions**
❌ Bad: "Compare them"
✅ Good: "Compare STR_002 vs STR_041 revenue"

### 2. **Use Entity Names**
❌ Bad: "Why low?"
✅ Good: "Why are stores underperforming?"

### 3. **Simple Questions Work Best Simply**
❌ Don't: "I need a comprehensive analysis of store count"
✅ Do: "How many stores?"

### 4. **Trust the Clarification Requests**
If the system asks for clarification, it's because your question was ambiguous. This prevents hallucination!

If not running:
```bash
ollama serve
```

### Issue: Slow responses
**Reason**: Ollama is running all LLM inference locally
**Solution**: Normal for local LLMs. Average 5-15 seconds.

### Issue: Port already in use

```bash
streamlit run decomposed_rag_app.py --server.port 8503
```
