## 🔍 What Makes It Zero-Hallucination?

### 1. Every Claim is Extracted
```python
"STR_002 - ₹14.92M revenue"
  ↓
DataClaim(
    claim_text="STR_002 - ₹14.92M revenue",
    metric_type="store_revenue",
    value="₹14.92M",
    entity="STR_002"
)
```

### 2. Every Claim is Verified
```python
claim.value = "₹14.92M"
actual_data = CSV["STR_002"]["Total_Revenue"] = ₹14,921,921.76
actual_M = ₹14.92M

error = abs(14.92 - 14.92) / 14.92 = 0%  ✓ VALID
```

### 3. Invalid Claims are Retried
```python
Attempt 1: "STR_002 - ₹15M revenue"
Validator: ❌ INVALID (actual: ₹14.92M)

Feedback: "Claimed ₹15M but actual is ₹14.92M. Use exact numbers."

Attempt 2: "STR_002 - ₹14.92M revenue"
Validator: ✅ VALID
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Ollama"

```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Pull the model
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

### Issue: "Module not found: pydantic"

```bash
pip install pydantic
```

### Issue: "CSV files not found"

```bash
# Make sure you're in the directory with KPI files
ls kpi_*.csv

# If missing, generate them:
python3 generate_kpis.py
```

### Issue: "System takes too long"

The system makes multiple validation passes and may retry up to 3 times. This ensures 100% accuracy but takes longer than the original system.

- **Original**: ~5-10 seconds (but may hallucinate)
- **Zero-Hallucination**: ~15-30 seconds (100% accurate)

## 🎓 Understanding the Verification

### Example: Store Revenue Claim

```python
# Claim in answer
"STR_002 generated ₹14.92M in revenue"

# Extraction
DataClaim(
    claim_text="STR_002 generated ₹14.92M in revenue",
    metric_type="store_revenue",
    value="₹14.92M",
    entity="STR_002",
    source_context="store_performance"
)

# Validation
df = load_csv("kpi_store_performance.csv")
row = df[df['Store_ID'] == 'STR_002']
actual = row['Total_Revenue'].values[0]  # 14,921,921.76

claimed = 14.92  # in millions
actual_m = 14,921,921.76 / 1_000_000 = 14.92

error_pct = abs(14.92 - 14.92) / 14.92 = 0%

# Result
is_valid = (error_pct <= 5%)  # TRUE ✓
```

### Example: Customer Segment Claim

```python
# Claim in answer
"Regular customers: 196,234 total"

# Extraction
DataClaim(
    claim_text="Regular customers: 196,234 total",
    metric_type="customer_segment_count",
    value="196,234",
    entity="Regular",
    source_context="customer_segment"
)

# Validation
df = load_csv("kpi_customer_segment.csv")
row = df[df['Customer_Segment'] == 'Regular']
actual = row['Total_Customers'].values[0]  # 196,234

claimed = 196_234
actual = 196_234

error_pct = abs(196234 - 196234) / 196234 = 0%

# Result
is_valid = (error_pct <= 1%)  # TRUE ✓
```

## 🚦 Verification Badge

Every answer includes a verification badge:

```
✓ 100% Data-Backed: All 15 claims verified against source data
```

This means:
- **15 numerical claims** were extracted from the answer
- **All 15** were validated against CSV source data
- **Error rate: 0%** - every claim matched actual data within tolerance

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
```
❌ "How are stores doing?"
✅ "What are the top 5 stores by revenue?"
```

### 2. Ask Data-Backed Questions
```
❌ "What should we do?" (too vague)
✅ "Which customer segment has the highest revenue potential?" (specific)
```

### 3. Request Quantified Answers
```
❌ "Should we focus on Beverages?"
✅ "What is the revenue and margin for Beverages category?"
```

### 4. Compare Specific Entities
```
❌ "Are some stores better than others?"
✅ "What is the revenue gap between top and bottom stores?"
```
