## üéØ How to Use

### Option 1: Direct Database Queries

Connect to PostgreSQL:
```bash
psql -d grocery_analytics
```

Example queries:
```sql
-- Total revenue
SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM transactions;

-- Top 10 products
SELECT * FROM top_products LIMIT 10;

-- Category performance
SELECT * FROM category_performance;

-- Customer segmentation
SELECT customer_type, COUNT(*), SUM(lifetime_value)
FROM customer_insights
GROUP BY customer_type;
```

### Option 2: Use Claude Code with MCP

The MCP server is at: `/Users/arghya.mukherjee/Downloads/cursor/sd/grocery_mcp_server.py`

#### In Claude Code:
Simply ask natural language questions like:

```
"Show me the top 10 products by revenue"
"What's the sales summary?"
"Analyze customer segments"
"Which season has the highest revenue?"
"Show store performance for all stores"
```

The MCP server will automatically query the database and format results.

### Option 3: Command Line MCP Testing

Test individual tools:
```bash
cd /Users/arghya.mukherjee/Downloads/cursor/sd

# Make script executable
chmod +x grocery_mcp_server.py

# The MCP server runs via stdio
# It's designed to be called by MCP-compatible clients (like Claude Code)
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Refreshing Materialized Views

When you add new data, refresh the pre-computed views:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales_summary;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW category_performance;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW top_products;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_insights;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW store_performance;
```

Or refresh all at once:
```bash
psql -d grocery_analytics -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_sales_summary; REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW category_performance; REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW top_products; REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_insights; REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW store_performance;"
```

### Custom SQL Queries

Complex analysis examples:

```sql
-- Revenue by day of week
SELECT
    EXTRACT(DOW FROM timestamp) as day_of_week,
    TO_CHAR(timestamp, 'Day') as day_name,
    COUNT(*) as transactions,
    SUM(total_amount) as revenue
FROM transactions
GROUP BY day_of_week, day_name
ORDER BY day_of_week;

-- Customer lifetime value buckets
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN lifetime_value < 500 THEN '< ‚Çπ500'
        WHEN lifetime_value < 1000 THEN '‚Çπ500-1,000'
        WHEN lifetime_value < 5000 THEN '‚Çπ1,000-5,000'
        ELSE '> ‚Çπ5,000'
    END as ltv_bucket,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    SUM(lifetime_value) as total_revenue
FROM customer_insights
GROUP BY ltv_bucket
ORDER BY MIN(lifetime_value);

-- Products with highest discount
SELECT
    product_name,
    category,
    AVG(discount_percentage) as avg_discount,
    COUNT(*) as times_discounted
FROM transactions
WHERE discount_percentage > 0
GROUP BY product_name, category
ORDER BY avg_discount DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Peak hours by day type
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN is_weekend THEN 'Weekend'
        WHEN is_holiday THEN 'Holiday'
        ELSE 'Weekday'
    END as day_type,
    time_slot,
    COUNT(*) as transactions,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_transaction
FROM transactions
GROUP BY day_type, time_slot
ORDER BY day_type, transactions DESC;
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
**Solution**: Check PostgreSQL is running:
```bash
pg_ctl status
# or
brew services list | grep postgresql
```

Start if needed:
```bash
brew services start postgresql@14
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Update DB_PARAMS in `grocery_mcp_server.py` with your username:
```python
DB_PARAMS = {
    'dbname': 'grocery_analytics',
    'user': 'YOUR_USERNAME',  # Update this
    'password': '',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': '5432'
}
```

### Issue: "Materialized view doesn't exist"
**Solution**: Re-run the data loading script:
```bash
python load_data_to_postgres.py
```

---

## üìä Performance Tips

### 1. Use Materialized Views
For frequently accessed data, query the materialized views instead of the main table:
- ‚úÖ `SELECT * FROM top_products LIMIT 10` (Fast)
- ‚ùå `SELECT ... FROM transactions GROUP BY ...` (Slow for 1.87M rows)

### 2. Use Indexes
All common query patterns have indexes:
- timestamp, store_id, product_id, customer_id, category, etc.

### 3. Limit Results
Always use LIMIT for large result sets:
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions LIMIT 1000;
```

### 4. Filter Early
Use WHERE clauses to reduce data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE timestamp >= '2023-01-01'
  AND category = 'Beverages'
LIMIT 100;
```
