## 📚 RAG Retrieval System

### What Gets Retrieved:

#### 1. **KPI Data** (from CSVs)
- Smart filtering based on question keywords
- Top N, bottom N, or all data as needed
- Multiple sources combined

Example:
```
Question: "What are top 5 stores?"

Retrieved:
- store_performance.csv (top 5 by revenue)
- Sorted, filtered, ready for generation
```

#### 2. **Business Metadata** (from JSON)
- Persona (Store Manager, 20+ years)
- Experience level
- Domain expertise
- Best practices
- Alert thresholds

Example:
```
Persona: "Seasoned Store Manager with 20+ years experience"
Experience: "Deep expertise in P&L, merchandising, inventory control"
```

#### 3. **Strategic Insights** (from MD files)
- Comprehensive business intelligence
- Revenue opportunities
- Customer segmentation strategies
- Operational excellence guidance

Example:
```
Revenue Opportunities:
- Occasional customers: ₹88M potential
- Inventory optimization: ₹8-12M savings
- Category mix: +2.5% margin improvement
```

#### 4. **Prompt Template** (for guidance)
- Store manager language examples
- Response structure guidance
- Golden rules for recommendations

Example:
```
Use language like:
✓ "Crushing it at ₹163M" (not "demonstrates strong performance")
✓ "Fix this by Friday" (not "we recommend implementing")
```

## 🎯 Multi-Answer Generation

### Strategy 1: DIRECT ANSWER
- **Target**: Simple questions needing just facts
- **Length**: 1-2 sentences
- **Content**: Specific numbers, direct answer
- **Use Case**: "How many stores?" → "50 stores"

```python
Prompt: "Answer directly and concisely. 1-2 sentences."
Output: "We have 50 stores total across our network."
Confidence: 0.7
```

### Strategy 2: CONTEXTUAL ANSWER
- **Target**: Questions needing insight
- **Length**: 2-3 sentences
- **Content**: Answer + key insight
- **Use Case**: "How are stores doing?" → Answer + reason

```python
Prompt: "Answer with context and key insight. 2-3 sentences."
Output: "We have 50 stores with ₹682M total revenue. Top 10 stores
         generate 35% of revenue, indicating concentration risk."
Confidence: 0.8
```

### Strategy 3: COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER
- **Target**: Complex questions needing analysis
- **Length**: 100-150 words
- **Content**: Answer + insight + recommendation
- **Use Case**: "Why are stores underperforming?" → Full analysis

```python
Prompt: "Comprehensive answer with analysis. 100-150 words."
Output: [Direct answer + Why + Recommendation with specific actions]
Confidence: 0.85
```

✗ Fail: No number, talks about something else
```

#### 2. **Uses Relevant Data** (20%)
```
✓ Pass: Contains numbers, store IDs (STR_XXX), ₹ amounts, %
✗ Fail: Generic statements, no specific data
```

#### 3. **Correct Entity Type** (20%)
```
Question: "stores performing?"

Question: "Why underperforming?" (complex)
✓ Pass: 100-150 words with analysis
✗ Fail: "Low performance" (too brief)
```

#### 5. **No Hallucination** (20%)
```
✓ Pass: All claims verifiable in context
✗ Fail: Made-up data, wrong entity type
```

### Alignment Score Calculation:
```
Alignment Score = (Check1 + Check2 + Check3 + Check4 + Check5) / 5

Example:
✓ Directly answers: 1
✓ Uses data: 1
✓ Correct entity: 1
✓ Appropriate detail: 1
✓ No hallucination: 1
---
Score: 5/5 = 100%
```

---

## 🏆 Best Answer Selection

### Selection Logic:

```python
# Find answer with highest alignment score
best_answer = max(candidates, key=lambda c: c.alignment_score)

# If tie, prefer higher confidence
if tie:
    best_answer = max(tied_candidates, key=lambda c: c.confidence)
```

### Example:

```
Candidate 1: Direct Answer
  Alignment: 80% (missing insight)
  Confidence: 0.7

Candidate 2: Contextual Answer
  Alignment: 100% (perfect!)
  Confidence: 0.8

Candidate 3: Comprehensive Answer
  Alignment: 90% (too detailed for simple Q)
  Confidence: 0.85

→ SELECTED: Candidate 2 (100% alignment)
```

## 📊 Complete Example Flow

### Question: "How many stores?"

#### Step 1: RAG Retrieval
```
Retrieved Context:
- store_performance.csv: 50 rows
- metadata: "Store Manager with 20+ years"
- insights: "50 stores, ₹682M network revenue"

Context size: 3,500 chars
```

#### Step 2: Generate 3 Candidates

**Candidate 1** (Direct):
```
Answer: "We have 50 stores in total."
Reasoning: Direct, minimal
Confidence: 0.7
```

**Candidate 2** (Contextual):
```
Answer: "We have 50 stores total across our retail network,
         generating ₹682M in combined revenue."
Reasoning: Contextual with data
Confidence: 0.8
```

**Candidate 3** (Comprehensive):
```
Answer: "We operate 50 stores across multiple regions with total
         revenue of ₹682M. The top 10 stores generate 35% of revenue
         (₹238M), while bottom 10 contribute only 14% (₹95M). This
         indicates performance concentration that needs attention."
Reasoning: Comprehensive with analysis
Confidence: 0.85
```

#### Step 3: Evaluate Each

**Candidate 1 Evaluation**:
```
✓ Directly answers: Yes (has number "50")
✓ Uses data: Yes (specific number)
✓ Correct entity: Yes (says "stores")
✓ Appropriate detail: Yes (brief for count query)
✓ No hallucination: Yes (verified)

Alignment Score: 100%
Issues: None
```

**Candidate 2 Evaluation**:
```
✓ Directly answers: Yes
✓ Uses data: Yes
✓ Correct entity: Yes
✗ Appropriate detail: No (too detailed for "how many")
✓ No hallucination: Yes

Alignment Score: 80%
Issues: ["Inappropriate detail level"]
```

**Candidate 3 Evaluation**:
```
✓ Directly answers: Yes
✓ Uses data: Yes
✓ Correct entity: Yes
✗ Appropriate detail: No (way too detailed for count query)
✓ No hallucination: Yes

Alignment Score: 80%
Issues: ["Inappropriate detail level"]
```

#### Step 4: Select Best

```
Winner: Candidate 1 (100% alignment)

Final Answer:
"We have 50 stores in total.

✓ Answer Quality: 100% - Highly aligned with your question"
