- Actionable recommendations: Not just 'Inventory turnover is low' but 'Inventory turnover is low because X, Y, Z → Do A, B, C'

DATA CORRELATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Internal KPIs ↔ Industry benchmarks (forecast accuracy, inventory turnover)
- Store performance ↔ Management experience and location quality
- Category sales ↔ Promotional strategies and margin impact
