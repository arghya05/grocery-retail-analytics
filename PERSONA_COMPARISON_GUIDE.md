## 🚀 Advanced Usage: Combining Both Personas

For comprehensive analysis, you can use both personas sequentially:

### Example: Beverage Category Strategy

**Step 1: CEO-Level Analysis**
```
Question: "Should we invest in beverage category dominance?"

CEO Response: "Yes. Beverages are ₹163.5M (24% of chain), high margin 
(35-40%). Strategic recommendation: Launch private label coffee (₹8M 
investment, 42% margins, ₹1.2M annual returns). Board approval Q2."
```

**Step 2: Store Manager Implementation**
```
Question: "How do I successfully launch private label coffee in MY store?"

Store Manager Response: "Your store sells ₹1.17M coffee annually (4.4% 
of store revenue). Plan: (1) Allocate 30% of coffee shelf space to 
private label, (2) Sample station near entrance for 2 weeks, (3) Price 
15% below branded, (4) Train staff on positioning. Expected: ₹350K 
private label sales in Year 1, ₹147K margin."
