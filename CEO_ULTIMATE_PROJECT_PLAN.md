## 🎯 PHASE 1: DATA ANALYSIS & METADATA CREATION (metadata_ceo/)

**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Input**: grocery_dataset.csv (24M+ rows, 39 columns)

  - Date range: MIN(timestamp) to MAX(timestamp)
  - Unique stores: COUNT(DISTINCT store_id)
  - Unique customers: COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
  - Unique products: COUNT(DISTINCT product_id)

**Columns to Analyze**:
```
transaction_id, timestamp, store_id, store_region, store_type,
product_id, product_name, category, sub_category, brand,
quantity, unit_price, discount_percentage, final_price, total_amount,
payment_method, customer_id, customer_type, loyalty_points_used, loyalty_points_earned,
age_group, gender, basket_size, is_weekend, is_holiday, season,
promotion_id, stock_level_at_sale, supplier_id, days_to_expiry,
weather_condition, temperature_celsius, delivery_method, time_slot,
