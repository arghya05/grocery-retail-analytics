## 🔍 How It Works

### 6-Agent Architecture (Ultra-Precise)

```
1. QUESTION UNDERSTANDING AGENT
   ↓ Detects: entity_type="store", intent="identify", filters={"performance": "low"}

2. SMART ROUTER
   ↓ Routes: Load store_performance data (NOT categories/segments)

3. CONTEXT LOADER
   ↓ Loads: Bottom stores by revenue

4. CONTEXT VALIDATOR
   ↓ Validates: Question asks STORES, data has STORES ✓

5. ANALYSIS AGENT
   ↓ Generates: Answer ONLY about STORES

6. ANSWER RELEVANCE CHECKER
   ↓ Validates: Answer discusses STORES (not categories) ✓
              Format is LIST ✓
              Includes performance metrics ✓
   ↓ Score: 100% relevance

FINAL ANSWER: Guaranteed to be about STORES

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### 1. Entity Type Detection
The system detects what the question asks about:
- **store**: "What are top stores?" → Loads store_performance
- **category**: "How is Beverages?" → Loads category_performance
- **customer_segment**: "Which segment?" → Loads customer_segment
- **product**: "Top products?" → Loads product_performance

### 2. Question Intent Recognition
- **identify**: "What are top 5 stores?" → Returns LIST
- **compare**: "Compare STR_002 vs STR_041" → Returns COMPARISON
- **recommend**: "Which segment to prioritize?" → Returns RECOMMENDATION
- **explain**: "Why is performance low?" → Returns EXPLANATION

### 3. Answer Relevance Scoring
```python
relevance_score = (
    entity_type_match +        # Talks about correct entity (store/category)?
    specific_entities_match +   # Mentions specific entities asked?
    intent_fulfilled +          # Provides what was asked (list/comparison)?
    metrics_included +          # Includes requested metrics (revenue/ATV)?
    format_correct             # Correct format (list/comparison/explanation)?
) / 5.0

# If score < 80% → RETRY with feedback
```

### 4. Hallucination Prevention
- **Claim Extraction**: Extract all numerical claims
- **Data Grounding**: Verify each claim against CSV data
- **Hallucination Grading**: LLM-as-judge checks if grounded in facts
- **Retry Mechanism**: Up to 3 attempts with specific feedback
