## üéì TECHNICAL APPROACH

### Currency Conversion Script
```python
# Key approach
INR_TO_USD = 83.0
chunk_size = 100000  # Process in chunks for large file

# Convert price columns
df['unit_price'] = df['unit_price'] / INR_TO_USD
df['final_price'] = df['final_price'] / INR_TO_USD
df['total_amount'] = df['total_amount'] / INR_TO_USD
```

### KPI Generation Script
```python
# 20 KPI dashboards generated from USD dataset
# Grouped by: store, category, customer, time, payment, etc.
# All metrics calculated in USD
# Sorted and formatted for executive consumption
```

### Story Structure
```markdown
# News Shorts Format
## Segment 1: Topic (60 seconds)
HEADLINE: Key insight
METRICS: Quantitative data
THE WHY: Root cause analysis
CONTEXT: Market/competitive intelligence
IMPLICATION: Strategic action required
```

**Innovation:** Integrated customer reviews, competitor intel, economic indicators with KPIs
**Benefit:** Answers "why" questions that numbers alone can't explain
**Example:** "Revenue down 5% in West" ‚Üí WHY? Competitor opened 3 stores nearby, weather patterns impacted traffic, customer sentiment shows dissatisfaction with produce quality

### 3. AI Initiatives Portfolio Approach
**Innovation:** Treated AI investments like VC portfolio (4 initiatives, diversified risk/return)
**Benefit:** Board can approve portfolio vs individual projects
**Structure:**
- Initiative 1: Quick win (6-month payback)

- Initiative 3: Recurring revenue (subscription model)
- Initiative 4: Strategic (platform business)

### 4. Three Paths Framework
**Innovation:** Present multiple strategic options with clear trade-offs
**Benefit:** Board makes informed choice vs rubber-stamping single plan
**Structure:**

### 5. Future Indicators Section
**Innovation:** Proactive risk flagging with leading indicators
**Benefit:** Board isn't surprised by problems - CEO is ahead of issues
**Examples:**
- Weather: Severe storms forecast in East (our growth market)
- Competition: Market leader announcing 5 stores in our territory
- Economic: Consumer confidence declining 3 months straight
- Regulatory: New food safety rules ($217K compliance cost)
